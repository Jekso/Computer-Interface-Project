# Computer-Interface-Project
It is a garage with a static number of slots for parking, using two IR module sensors as an input to our system in case a car or more is entering or exiting the garage and then we can output the number of free slots on the seven segment and also see it on our GUI Program and according to the input sensors, if the signal is coming from entrance sensor gate the entrance dc motor will work to open the gate so the car can get in and if the signal is coming from exit sensor gate the exit dc motor will work to open the gate so the car can get out.
